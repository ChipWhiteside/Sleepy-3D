# Sleepy-3D
 
Infinite runner style game where you play as Sleepy's guardian angel, protecting him from the hoardes of nightmares descending upon him. Fight your way through the nightmares, upgrading your tools and abilities along the way. But watch out, the little monsters aren't the only ones with their sights on Sleepy.


Still early in development currently. Most base functionality is implemented but once the core 'game' is there, I'll be sure to upload a demo you can try out! Check back in soon :)
